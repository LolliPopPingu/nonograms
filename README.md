nonograms
=========
*also known as picross*

nonograms is a HTML 5 nonogram puzzle game. It's pure HTML, CSS and Javascript - no server side scripting required!

It's very easy to add your own puzzles! Just open up js/puzzles.js and follow the examples.

Thanks to [janspa](https://github.com/janspa) for writing some of the event handler code!

### Known bugs:
* A puzzle must have an equal number of rows and columns. This will be fixed in a future update.
